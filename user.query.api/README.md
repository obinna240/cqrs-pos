Query API handles the Q side of CQRS.
The QUERY side.
It is responsible for subscribing to User events generated by the command and using the User repository
it perfroms any updates to the READ database.

It is also responsible for hanlding queries i.e.requests for which there is a need to READ.
E.G GetUser.

To this end, this handler has two primary modules, a module to handle the User Events and a
module for querying.

Both modules communicate with the UserRepository interface which enables read operations on the 
READ DB.

### Classes
It includes the UserEventHandler interface which handles 3 methods or the 3 events we generate i.e. the userRegisteredEvern, UserRemovedEvent and UserUpdatedEvent

Query
-
We create classes to query the read database.
We also need handlers to handle incoming query requests.
